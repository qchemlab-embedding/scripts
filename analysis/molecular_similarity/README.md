# Technicalities

This analysis is demonstrated in a jupyter notebook.

To run it, please follow these steps:

0. prepare a working environment using conda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/)

  * install Anaconda on your computer: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/
  * create conda environment from the attached `environment.yml` file:

    ```
    conda env create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml
    ```

  * activate this environment (follow the instructions in the terminal)

## How to view this analysis:

* in the terminal with activated conda environment, run:

  ```
  jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
  ```

* if you are asked for the code or password (there is no), then follow the instructions from the terminal;
  there should be a link to a website (someting similar to: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/analysis.ipynb);
  open this link in your browser.

* if the code is not executed automatically, click on "Run" -> "Run All Cells"
